## User Experience (UX) | The 5 Planes

This project was planned using the fundamentals of the five planes of UX design, as outlined in Jesse James Gerrett's book, **The Elements of User Experience**. To assit me in planning the project, I used a combination of the source material videos provided by Code Institute in the *It's All About The User Experience Module*, as well as an article by Urooj Qureshi called [*UX Design using the Five Planes Method*](https://medium.com/designcentered/ux-design-5-planes-method-b1b1d6587c05). The below five planes acted as a framework for which my project was planned:

1. The Strategy Plane
2. The Scope Plane
3. The Structure Plane
4. The Skeleton Plane
5. The Surface Plane
