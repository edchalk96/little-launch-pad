### Background

As a father to a preschool-aged son, my motivation for developing an interactive, web-based quiz game is twofold: to aid his learning of basic concepts and prepare him for primary school while at home, and to concurrently help him develop essential fine motor skills and a basic understanding of interacting with smart devices. Recognizing the financial and availability challenges many parents face regarding childcare, this tool is designed to be a beneficial resource for other guardians seeking to support their child's early education. Furthermore, this project serves as my Milestone Project 2 for the Code Institute Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development as well as being added to my project portfolio.

## User Experience (UX) | The 5 Planes

This project was planned using the fundamentals of the five planes of UX design, as outlined in Jesse James Gerrett's book, **The Elements of User Experience**. To assit me in planning the project, I used a combination of the source material videos provided by Code Institute in the *It's All About The User Experience Module*, as well as an article by Urooj Qureshi called [*UX Design using the Five Planes Method*](https://medium.com/designcentered/ux-design-5-planes-method-b1b1d6587c05). The below five planes acted as a framework for which my project was planned:

1. The Strategy Plane
2. The Scope Plane
3. The Structure Plane
4. The Skeleton Plane
5. The Surface Plane

### Strategy Plane

### *Creator Goals*

The main objective for the developer of this interactive web-based quiz is to aid pre-school children in their learning of fundamental concepts whilst simulataneously introducing a basic understanding of device interaction and developing fine motor skills. In order to do this the project will require the following:

- A simple site structure with minimal content to not overwhelm
- Several quiz games of basic fundamental concepts, like colours, numbers, shapes, animals, and feelings etc
- An engaging and fun theme with a colour scheme targetted at creating a calm yet engaging environment, avoiding over stimulation
- Have simple, intuitive navigation between the home page and quiz games
- To include a how to play section in the home page for the parent to read on first visit/use or as a reminder
- Inclusion of a volume on or off button for if the parent would like to read out the questions instead of being from the website
- Inclusion of positive feedback for correct answers as well as a gentle nudge to the correct answer for self correction. Avoiding any harshly negative feedback

### *User Stories*

The overall goal of the users, child and parent/guardian (P/G) for this project is to learn basic fundamental concepts whilst also having fun doing so.

#### First Time Visitor Goals

- **Child** | To initially be shown how the quiz game works by a parent/guardian
- **P/G** | To read about the quiz game and how to play
- **P/G** | To show child how to play and interact with the quiz game
- **P/G** | To chose whether the quiz game reads out the question or the P/G does
- **Child** | Be able to choose from several different quiz games 
- **Child** | Begin to learn/improve on the fundamental concepts included in content of the quiz games

#### Returning Visitor Goals

- **Child** | Improve on the understanding of how to interact and navigate the quiz game
- **Child** | Improve knowledge of the concepts in the games

#### Frequent User Goals

- **Child** | Be able to fully navigate and interact with the quiz game intuitively
- **Child** | Have fun improving/reinforcing the concepts into knowledgebase
- **P/G** | Observe child progress with their understanding of the concepts included
- **P/G** | Observe child progress with relevant fine motor skills and confidence of using relevant smart device

#### Opportunities

Based on the above goals, the following oppurnities were mapped out:

| Oppurtunity                 | Importance | Viability/Feasibility |
| --------------------------- | :--------: | :-------------------: |
| How to play section         | 5          | 5                     |
| Colour match quiz           | 5          | 5                     |
| Number match quiz           | 4          | 5                     |
| Faces and feelings quiz     | 5          | 4                     |
| Animal sounds quiz          | 3          | 1                     |
| Shape selection quiz        | 5          | 4                     |
| Letter match quiz           | 4          | 5                     |
| Difficulty/Age mode         | 1          | 1                     |
| Audio toggle button         | 4          | 3                     |
| Contact link/information    | 3          | 5                     |
| Positive feedback responses | 5          | 4                     |
| Self-correction feedback    | 5          | 4                     |
|                             | **54**     | **51**                |

### Scope Plane

---

Mapping out the oppurtunities has revealed that not all of the features will be in scope as part of the initial development of this project. The following have been decided to be in scope:

 - A how to play section outlining the instrctions of the quiz game to the P/G 
 - Colour match quiz
 - Number match quiz
 - Faces and feelings quiz
 - Shape selection quiz
 - An audio toggle button
 - Contact link/information to the developer/project owner
 - Positive feedback responses to encourage the child and keep the project fun and interactive
 - Self-correction feedback to allow the child to select the correct answer for themselves and learn, keeping the fun aspect

 Additionally, using the strategy plane as a guide, other elememts have been identified to be included in the scope of the project:

 - A minimalistic, clean and clutter free design, with minimal buttons or links
 - A colour scheme appropriate for and targetted towards a pre-school aged demographic
 - For familiarality throughout, a consistent look and navigation with the only changes being the home page and the varying quiz contents

The features decided to not been in scope for the initial development of this project include the difficulty/age mode selection, as well as the animal sounds and number match quiz. The decision for the exclusion of the difficulty/age mode selection was due to the lack of importance, as the target demographic is a small age difference were the difficulty level is likely to be similar. In future, the project, can be developed further for older children and include more diffuclt quizzes were this feature would be more important. The exclusion of the animal sounds quiz was due to, at the time of writing, a lack of knowledge/experience in the languages and/or techniques required to make this feature a reality. In addition to this, due to time contraints, a decision was made to only include 4 different quiz games and therefore the animal sounds quiz and the letter match quix were chosen to be excluded from the scope at this stage.

### Structure Plane

---

The Little Launch Pad project will utilize a theme specifically designed for preschool children (ages 2-4). Careful research will inform the selection of the color scheme, imagery, and other design elements, ensuring the final product remains fun and interactive without being visually overwhelming for the target audience.

#### Layout

To ensure the application is simple and intuitive for preschool children, the design will incorporate a more linear narrative structure. The main homepage will serve as the central hub, providing access to four distinct quiz games, "How to Play" instructions, contact details, and an audio toggle. Navigation elements intended for the child user (links to quiz games) will be significantly larger and more prominent than those for the P/G. Within the quiz sections, the only navigation available will be a simple return button to the homepage, reinforcing a straightforward structure essential for this young demographic.
