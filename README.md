### Background

As a father to a preschool-aged son, my motivation for developing an interactive, web-based quiz game is twofold: to aid his learning of basic concepts and prepare him for primary school while at home, and to concurrently help him develop essential fine motor skills and a basic understanding of interacting with smart devices. Recognizing the financial and availability challenges many parents face regarding childcare, this tool is designed to be a beneficial resource for other guardians seeking to support their child's early education. Furthermore, this project serves as my Milestone Project 2 for the Code Institute Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development as well as being added to my project portfolio.

## User Experience (UX) | The 5 Planes

This project was planned using the fundamentals of the five planes of UX design, as outlined in Jesse James Gerrett's book, **The Elements of User Experience**. To assit me in planning the project, I used a combination of the source material videos provided by Code Institute in the *It's All About The User Experience Module*, as well as an article by Urooj Qureshi called [*UX Design using the Five Planes Method*](https://medium.com/designcentered/ux-design-5-planes-method-b1b1d6587c05). The below five planes acted as a framework for which my project was planned:

1. The Strategy Plane
2. The Scope Plane
3. The Structure Plane
4. The Skeleton Plane
5. The Surface Plane

### *Creator Goals*

The main objective for the developer of this interactive web-based quiz is to aid pre-school children in their learning of fundamental concepts whilst simulataneously introducing a basic understanding of device interaction and developing fine motor skills. In order to do this the project will require the following:

- A simple site structure with minimal content to not overwhelm
- Several quiz games of basic fundamental concepts, like colours, numbers, shapes, animals, and feelings etc
- An engaging and fun theme with a colour scheme targetted at creating a calm yet engaging environment, avoiding over stimulation
- Have simple, intuitive navigation between the home page and quiz games
- To include a how to play section in the home page for the parent to read on first visit/use or as a reminder
- Inclusion of a volume on or off button for if the parent would like to read out the questions instead of being from the website
- Inclusion of positive feedback for correct answers as well as a gentle nudge to the correct answer for self correction. Avoiding any harshly negative feedback

### *User Stories*

The overall goal of the users, child and parent/guardian (P/G) for this project is to learn basic fundamental concepts whilst also having fun doing so.

#### First Time Visitor Goals

- **Child** | To initially be shown how the quiz game works by a parent/guardian
- **P/G** | To read about the quiz game and how to play
- **P/G** | To show child how to play and interact with the quiz game
- **Child** | Begin to learn/improve on the fundamental concepts included in content of the quiz games

#### Returning Visitor Goals

- **Child** | Improve on the understanding of how to interact and navigate the quiz game
- **Child** | Improve knowledge of the concepts in the games

#### Frequent User Goals

- **Child** | Be able to fully navigate and interact with the quiz game intuitively
- **Child** | Have fun improving/reinforcing the concepts into knowledgebase
- **P/G** | Observe child progress with their understanding of the concepts included
- **P/G** | Observe child progress with relevant fine motor skills and confidence of using relevant smart device
